Q: 1. Software Life Cycle
A: <br>A process for planning, creating, testing and deploying an information system.
Q: 2. Software Quality (What are the attributes?)
A: <br>An attribute of a product or process that, if improved, would better satisfy one or more of the stakeholders of that product or service. <ul><li>Usability</li> <li>Efficiency</li> <li>Reliability</li> <li>Maintainability</li> <li>Reusability</li></ul>
Q: 3. Agile
A: <br>Iterative software engineering philosophy that emphasizes the ability to quickly modify software (test-first development). <br><br>Gather requirements in small increments, and design and implement each small increment before the next. <br><br>May require design changes/refactoring along the way to accommodate new requirements.
Q: 4. Waterfall
A: <br>Completely finishing each step of software production before moving on to the next. <br><br>e.g., Develop requirements, design, program, test, deploy.
Q: 5. Types of Projects
A: <br><b>Custom</b>: Developed to meet the needs of a particular customer, and tends to be of little use to others. (websites, air-traffic control systems, managing finances of a company) <br><br><b>Generic</b>: Designed to be sold on the open market to meet needs of many customers on general purpose PCs. Also called Commercial Off-The-Shelf software (COTS). (word processors, spreadsheets, browsers, OSs) <br><br><b>Embedded</b>: Runs specific hardware devices typically sold on open market. Does not allow replacing/upgrading software without replacing hardware. Accounts for bulk of software in existence.
Q: 6. Real Time vs. Data Processing Software
A: <b>Real Time:</b> <ul><li>Has to react immediately to stimuli.</li><li>Often used to operate special purpose hardware.</li><li>Almost all embedded systems run in real time.</li></ul><br><ul><li>Used to run business.</li><li>e.g., recording sales, managing accounts, printing bills.</li><li>rather than processing data the moment it is available, it is instead gathered together in batches to be processed at a later time.</li></ul>
